WELCOME TO MOWERGT SIMULATOR:

A game made by two students of videogame develop and design in the UPC made with Bullet for the subject physics II.



The project is a simulation of a vehicle, in this case a mower.

The game it's set in a farm where a circuit has been constructed for the classification to the world mower championship
and the player has to made a lap in the less time possible to be able to pass to the championship. There is a maximum time
that can change depending on the level of difficulty.

There are 4 levels of difficulty:
	-Level 1: Maximum time is 80 seconds
	-Level 2: Maximum time is 70 seconds
	-Level 3: Maximum time is 60 seconds
	-Level 4: Maximum time is 50 seconds

In the map there are some objects that can make you delay in your lap.Those objects are some trunks and fish traps that
you can find in the river. If you touch any fish trap you wont be able to pass through the farmer's house and you will 
have to go around the house what means more time to complete the lap and player won't be able to go to the championship.
